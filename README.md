# growth mindset 
#### describse the underlying beliefs people have about learning and intelligence. When students believe they can get smarter, they understand that effort makes them stronger,Therefore they put in extra time and effort, and that leads to higher achievement. On the othre hand, the fixed mind describes people who see their qualities as fixed traits that cannot change. With a fixed mindset, talent is enough to lead to success and effort to improve these talents isn’t required: one is born with a certain amount of skill and intelligence that can’t be improved upon.

  1. Growth:Facing the problems give you one step ahead by working and discovering the solution then you will have more experience as we saw in the example with our friend who works with Jira.
  2. Fixed: Avoiding the challenge will let you stay in the bottom because you will always rely on the comfront zone not be able to discover yourself and make a progress as our friend.
