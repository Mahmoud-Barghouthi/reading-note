### what is Domain Modeling
#### Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. Also to vaidate the undersranding of a specific problem among various stakeholders

### How to define a contructor and initalize properties ?
#### To define the same properties between many objects, you'll want to use a constructor function. Below is a table that summarizes a JavaScript representation of an EpicFailVideo objec
#### Generate random numbers
#### To model the random nature of user behavior, you'll need the help of a random number generator. Fortunately, the JavaScript standard library includes a Math.random() function for just this sort of occasion.

### Tables
#### Long Tables
#### There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows (which can contain different content)

< thead >
#### The headings of the table should sit inside the <thead> element. 
< tbody >
#### The body should sit inside the < tbody > element. 
< tfoot >
#### The footer belongs inside the < tfoot > element.By default, browsers rarely treat the content of these elements any differently than other elements however designers often use CSS styles to change their appearance

### Old Code:
### Width & Spacing

#### The width attribute was used on the opening <table> tag to indicate how wide that table should be and on some opening <th> and <td> tags to specify the width of individual cells. The value of this attribute is the width of the table or cell in pixels.

### Border & Background
#### The border attribute was used on both the <table> and <tdelements to indicate the width of the border in pixels.

### How to create an Object
#### 1. Create new object using a combination of the new Keyword and the object constructor function.

#### 2. Having created the blank object, you can add its properties and metthods

### Updating an object
#### TO update the value of properties, use dot notation or square brackets.

### CREATING MANY OBJECTS:

### CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION
#### Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things. 
### Object constructors can use functionas a template for creating objects. First, create the template with the object's properties and methods.
