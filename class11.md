### Controlling sizes of the images in CSS
#### You can control the size of an image using the *width* and *height* properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box

### Aligning Images Using CSS

1: The float property is added 
to the class that was created to 
represent the size of the image 
(such as the small class in our 
example).

2: New classes are created with 
names such as align-left or 
align-right to align the images 
to the left or right of the page. 
These class names are used in 
addition to classes that indicate 
the size of the image.

### Centering Images using css
1: On the containing element, 
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.

2: On the image itself, you can 
use the use the margin property 
and set the values of the left and 
right margins to auto.

## Background Images
### background-image
The background-image
property allows you to place 
an image behind any HTML 
element. This could be the entire 
page or just part of the page. By 
default, a background image will 
repeat to fill the entire box


## Repeating Images
### Background-repeat
### Background-attachment
repeat

The background image is 
repeated both horizontally and 
vertically (the default way it 
is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).

repeat-x

The image is repeated 
horizontally only (as shown in 
the first example on the left).
repeat-y
The image is repeated vertically 
only.

no-repeat

The image is only shown once.
The background-attachment 
property specifies whether a 
background image should stay in 
one position or move as the user 
scrolls up and down the page. It 
can have one of two values:

fixed

The background image stays in 
the same position on the page.

scroll

The background image moves 
up and down as the user scrolls 
up and down the page
