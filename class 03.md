![list](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5e46ef60397c182fec255f32_02_14_2020/lists.png)
#### Types of list:

```
Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered
Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

```
```
 Ordered Lists
 < ol>The ordered list is created with the < ol> element.
 < li>Each item in the list is placed between an opening < li > tag and a closing < /li > tag.(The listands for list item.)
```
```
 Unordered Lists
 < ul>The unordered list is created with the <ul> element.
 < li>Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing < /li> tag. (The listands for list item.)
``` 
``` 
Definition List
< ul> The unordered list is created with the <ul> element. < li> Each item in the list is placed between an opening < li> tag and a closing < / li> tag.(The listands for list item.)
< dt>
This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
< dd>
This is used to contain the 
definition

### Box Dimension
#### Width, Height
#### By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties

### Limiting Width
### min-width, max-width
 ---
 ### Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs,the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide
 ----

 ### Limiting Height
 #### In the same way that you might want to limit the width of a box on a page, you may also want to limit the height of it. This is achieved using the min-height and max-height properties.

 ### Overflowing Content
 #### overflow 
 #### The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:

 Type 1 | Description
 --- | ---
 Hidden | This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box
SCroll | This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.
-----

### Border, Margin & Padding
### Border 
#### Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another
### Margin 
#### Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
### Padding
#### Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.
---------
Borders Type | Border Command
---|---
Width | border-width
Style | border-style
Color | border-color
-----

 Type |  Command
---|---
padding | top - bottom - left - right
Margin | top - bottom - left - right

### Arrays
#### An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

#### You can create it by using the var follwoed with the name of the array

#### An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

### IF ELSE Statement
![ifelse](https://i.redd.it/fm7z08nffkk51.jpg)

#### it checks a condition. if it resolves to true the first code block is excuted else it resolves to false the second code block.

### When we use IF and Else
#### Here you can see that an if ... e1se statement allows you to provide two sets of code: 
1. one set if the condition 
evaluates to true 
2. another set if the condition is 
false 
-----

### Switch Statements
#### A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

### Using of Switch Statement
#### 1.TYPE COERCION & WEAK TYPING
#### 2.TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES
#### 3.CHECKING EQUALITY & EXISTENCE 
#### 4.SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES

----
#### Loops
#### For  to run code a specific numbers of time.
#### While  if you don't know how many to use it.
#### Do While  Very Similar to the while but it will always run the statements inside the curly braces
