### Forms
#### Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains spaces for you to fill in information

### Form Controls

#### 1. Adding Text
#### 2. Making Choices 
#### 3. Submitting forms
#### 4 Uploading Files

#### Form Structure < form >
#### There are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site

#### Text Input
#### The < input > element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the typeattribute determines what kind of input they will be creating

#### Type="password" When the type attribute has a value of password it creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input, except the characters are blocked out. They are hidden in this way so that if someone is looking over the user's shoulder, they cannot see sensitive data such as passwords

#### The < Textarea > element is used to create a mutli-line text input. Unlike other input elements this is not an empty element. It should therefore have an opening and a closing tag

#### Checkbox
#### type="checkbox"Checkboxes allow users to select (and unselect) one or more options in answer to a question.

#### decimal-leading-zero
#### 01 02 03
#### lower-alpha
#### a b c
#### upper-alpha
#### A B C
#### lower-roman
#### i. ii. iii

#### Styling Forms
#### Nobody I know enjoys filling in forms, so if you can make yours look more attractive and easier to use, more people arelikely to fill it in. Also, when you come to look at a form in a few different browsers (as shown on the right), you will see that each browser displays them differently

### Aligning Form Controls : Problem
#### Labels for form elements are often different lengths, which means that the form controls will not appear in a straight line. This is demonstrated in the example on the right (without CSS applied to the form controls).

### Events
#### When you browse the web, your browser registers different types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this just happened." Your script can then respond to these events.

### HOW EVENTS TRIGGER JAVASCRIPT CODE
#### When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code.
