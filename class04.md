#### Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing

#### Writing Links
#### Links are created using the < a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening < a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute
-------
#### Linking to Other Sites
#### Links are created using the < a>element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link

------------
#### When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL

#### Directory Structure
#### On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories

#### Relative URLs
#### Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browserwhere to find your files.

#### Email Links
#### To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the < a >element

#### Opening Links ina New Window
#### target If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening < a > tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank

#### Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page
#### At the top of a long page you might want to add a list of contents that links to the corresponding sections lower down. Or you might want to add a link from part way down the page back to the top of it to save users from having to scroll back to the top

#### Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page
#### If you want to link to a specific part of a different page (whether on your own site or a different website) you can use a similar technique

### Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
#### Building Blocks CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-levelbox or an inline box

### Containing Elements
#### If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

### Controlling the Position of Elements
#### CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

#### To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed. (You will meet these when we introduce the positioning schemes on the following pages.)

### Normal Flow
#### position:static
#### In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow.

-----
### Relative Positioning
#### Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.

### Screen Sizes
#### Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

### Screen Resolution
#### Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens

### Page Sizes
#### Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

### Fixed Width Layouts
#### Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels

### Liquid Layouts
#### Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages

### Layout Grids
#### Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement of visual elements — how they are organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.

### Functions, Methods, and Objects
#### Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
#### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

### Declare a function
#### to create a function, give it a name and write the statements that will do that task


### ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS & FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS

#### Expressions produce a value. They can be used where values are expected. If a function is placed where a browser expects to see an expression, (e.g., as an argument to a function), then it gets treated as an expression.
