#### THE DOCUMENT OBJECT REPRESENTS AN HTML PAGE
###### By using the document object, you can edit, add and delete of any contents that the users can see and to manage how they interact with it.

##### Today we are going to speak about document object and its main features.
##### 1. Properties
###### it describes characteristics of the current web page (such as the title of the page)

##### 2. METHODS
###### it performs tasks the related with the documents that already loaded in the browsers.

##### 3. Events
######   By responding to events, when a user make a click or tapping on an element or a button in the webiste

###### People who already have created a browsers will have:
###### 1. Implemented properties that you can access to find out about the current page in the browser
###### 2. Written methods that achieve some common tasks that you are likely to want to do with an HTML page 

#### HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE

###### You need to understand and to know how a browser interprets the HTML code and applies its style in order to know how you can change the content of any HTML.

##### The following information below will help you with that

###### 1. RECEIVE A PAGE AS HTML CODE 
###### 2. CREATE A MODEL OF THE PAGE AND STORE IT IN MEMORY
###### 3. USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN 

#### *Special Note*
#### *all major browsers use a JavaScript interpreter to translate your instructions (in JavaScript) into instructions the computer can follow.* 

#### HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER

Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. | Where possible, aim to keep the three languages in separate files with the HTML page linking to CSS and JavaScript files   
 ---------|-----------|
Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose. Each layer, from left to right. builds on the previous one |

Layer Type | files
------- | --------
CONTENT LAYER | html files This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.
PRESENTATION LAYER | css files The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.)
BEHAVIOR layer| .js files This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files. 

#### PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT
##### These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement. see the picture below.
